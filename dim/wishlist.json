{"description":"","name":"SticksJabroni","data":[{"description":"Given Psi Aeterna IV is a special ammo weapon, we want to maximise the Handling, so Quick Launch and a Handling masterwork are ideal. Appended Mag is our magazine of choice because it offers some auto-reloading features and is the best magazine without any negative trade-offs.\n\nFor perks, we recommend Trickle Charge as it allows you to continuously fire the weapon in DPS scenarios where this weapon will likely truly shine. However, if you want something more general, Blast Disruptor is a very suitable alternative. For perk 2, again, focusing on DPS, Elemental Honing is by far the best option. This perk will also simply activate in moment-to-moment gameplay, boosting your damage by a solid amount, particularly if you are on Prismatic. However, if you would rather lean further into Arc, Jolting Feedback is a great alternative.","hash":3556730800,"name":"Blueberries","plugs":[[3525010810],[1087426260],[1115162408,1017229899],[1089671869,3966416502],[3846229553]],"tags":["PVE"]},{"description":"On Mistral Lift, we first take Fluted Barrel as it boosts the Handling and Stability of the weapon, making it easier to use. For the magazine, you can go with either Liquid Coils or Accelerated Coils. The latter will do slightly more damage per second, but Liquid Coils will be more damage overall, however, the actual damage difference between both options is very low. Charge Time is the best masterwork available.\n\nFor perks, we suggest Envious Arsenal in the first column as it is an excellent reload perk, however, Reconstruction is an okay backup. Bait and Switch is the go-to for perk 2 as it is the best damage perk available on Mistral Lift, but Precision Instrument is a reasonable backup option.","hash":766122634,"name":"Blueberries","plugs":[[1840239774],[689005463,1687452232],[3987942396,1523832109],[3078487919,555281244],[3988215619]],"tags":["PVE"]},{"description":"First and foremost, we’ll need to address that high heat-generating stat. Being at a base of 90 means it doesn’t take long to reach the max, so Ionized Heatsink and a Heat Generation Masterwork should knock it down to a more comfortable 60. And as always, Fluted Barrel provides the overall QoL.\\n\\nPerk 1 has no real competition thanks to Destabilizing Rounds appearing in this column instead of Perk 2, but Cooling Baubles is a solid alternative for dealing with heat buildup. Speaking of Perk 2, you’ll find far more choices here, but we believe Thermal Atomization or Desperate Measures are your best choices to make this weapon the best it can be, especially with the high heat stat making TA up almost always.","hash":2819552809,"name":"Blueberries","plugs":[[1840239774],[807993149],[2048641572,3932949589],[1909124648,776531651,2109543898],[1309453587]],"tags":["PVE"]},{"description":"With how low the range is on this weapon, it’s not worth going for solely range-boosting barrels and batteries, so it’s best to spread it out amongst the lesser stats, which, thankfully, here are just range and stability. Smallbore, Particle Repeater, and a Range masterwork are all you need to get your stats in the right place.\\n\\nAs for your perks, Perk 1 has the granddaddy of range boosters: Rangefinder. Now granting +10 range on ADS, you’re hitting even farther than before! Delicate Tuning gets an honorable mention, but as it decays in effectiveness as you reach 50% heat, it’s not worth it unless you really pace those shots. Perk 2 has a good variety of damage boosters, but Kill Clip or Desperate Measure are arguably your best choices given the current sandbox.

This feeds Jolting Feedback perfectly as sustained damage applies Jolt. Doing this while Amplified applies Jolt in fewer shots.

Sign off with Precision Instrument, which rewards an accurate trigger finger with a stacking damage increase of up to 25 percent as long as no shots are missed and the weapon is not reloaded.
